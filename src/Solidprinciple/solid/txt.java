    /*Single Responsibility--Each class should have only one sole purpose
    and not be filled with excessive functionality

    *Open closed--classes shou;d be open for extension,closed for modification.
    in other words,you should not have to rewrite an existing class for implementing new features.

    *Liskov Substitution-- this means that every subclass or derived clASS  should be substitutable for their
    base or parent class

    *Interface  segregation -- interfaces should not force classes to implement what they cant do.
    large interface should be divided into small ones.

    *Dependency inversion -- Components should depend on abstractions,not on concretions.*/
